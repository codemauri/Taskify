Read `ideas.md` and select an idea to work on next and tell me what it is.

If the file does not exist stop and inform user there is no `ideas.md` file

Take into consideration any user_feedback when selecting idea.

<user_feedback>
$ARGUMENTS
</user_feedback>

If the user accepts the idea create a feature branch for the idea and work on it in that branch.

If the idea requires research to properly implement use the @research-documentation-agent if its available
